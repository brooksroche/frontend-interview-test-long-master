UI Engineer Code Challenge

You should have by now been given all the code to begin this code challenge. 
(/codetest) The end goal is to make a simple commenting/posting engine that stores the data into local storage and then pushes it later on (depending on internet connection) to an external data source.

What we are looking to get out of this challenge is to test your aptitude in several areas:
	Ability to bind into/use existing markup/css/models
	Take a screenshot of the design with some dimensions and create the css markup and layout from it.
	Determine how you layout your code and what frameworks youï¿½re using.
	See how you deal with MVC style of programming



The following are the conditions we want you to fulfill
	Write the html and css need to finish the mock. see styles.css and index.html. you don't have to keep these files
	Create posts and comments while offline - pretend that you have a spotty connection
	Display the data contained in posts.json and users.json on the page
	Be able to create a new post
	Be able to leave a new comment on any post
	Store new comments and posts in localstorage (in theory the data in localstorage should be able to be sent to the server once there is a stable connection)


Here are some of the assumptions of the challenge.
	You are logged in as user id 5.
	the models for the posts and user data are in the /data folder (posts.json, users.json)
	There needs to be an "interface" for the following:
		post
		comment
		user



You are free to use any framework(s) of your choice. Also feel free to structure your code in any way. 

Check in resources for box.js its a localstorage framework. it works for anything that supports window.localstorage its kinda buggy for anything else but will get the job done. Or roll up your own if you wish.
